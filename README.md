# Cli-lang - C LIke LANGuage
A C-like language, with prefix notation and in which functions return types are expressed somewhat differently

## Compiling
To compile, you'll need flex, bison, GNU make, and a C compiler that supports at least C11. If you have all those
then you do:
```
git clone https://github.com/aslikr42069/my_c-like_lang.git
cd my_c-like_lang
make
```
